Version 0.1 (25-06-05)
 - Initial release
 
Version 0.2
 - Added jacman.disposeMainMenu property. When true, if pacman is run within the Install/
   Remove/Update dialogs, when the Done button is clicked, Jacman closes. Otherwise, closing
   the dialog will take you back to the main menu.
 - Added checks for the "empty" package bug that iphitus reported. Don't know what causes it
   as I can't reproduce it. However, when generating the package tables, there is a check to 
   ensure blank packages are not added.
 - Add support for the ILoveCandy option when parsing pacman.conf
 - Some internal restructuring of classes and packages.
 - Did some spring-cleaning with the source. Namely the removal of unnecessary commented out
   lines of code.
 - Added "curses emulation" to the console dialogs
 - Added support for confirming/aborting operations, to the console dialogs
 - Added Ant Buildscript for easy building, packaging and running   lines of code.
 - Added acknowledgements to Jon-Anders (soniX) and added proper name for Sudman1.
 - Added i18n support for ConsoleDialog.
