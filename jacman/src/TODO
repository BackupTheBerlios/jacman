Jacman TODO List
================

This file contains all the current ideas of features that will go into Jacman.
The next version will contained quite detailed plans, whereas versions further
away have more abstract concepts.

Version 0.3
===========

* Use updated GlazedLists 0.9.7 to take advantage of speed improvements and bug fixes.
* [DONE]Use a better component for the console, such as JEditorPane to enable colour highlighting of output.
  E.g., red text for errors.
* Options dialog.
* Acquire package category data and implement filters based on them.
* Add license info to all classes
* Commence full JavaDoc for classes (maybe only andy.jacman and andyr.jacman.console for this version)
* Add i18n support to exception messages.
* Add option on main menu for Pacman optimise?
* Fix the non-transparant JFrame icon.
* Improve About dialog. Use proper JDialog rather than JOptionPane.
* Remove dependency on Tahoma. Use Trebuchet which *is* part of ttf-ms-fonts, or an equivalent free font.

* Add tray icon for jacman with standard tasks
* Add time-triggered "silent" -Suy with notification in tray (I might wait with this feature until jacmans architecture improves)

Version 0.4
===========

* Add a srcpac interface? (Get Sudman1 on board?)
* Dialog showing pacman.conf settings
* Make Jacman more graceful when problems occur. For example, exit cleanly for invalid pacman.conf.
* Think of nice way to present exceptions. Currently they are all outputed to stderr. Some need
  to be made visible.
  
Down the road...
================
* Refactor Jacman to separate data, controller and view.
* Change architecture to client/server, to allow a Jacman client to control several machines running Jacman servers.
* Change Jacman-server to support other package managers ?
